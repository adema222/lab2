        <p>Blogging which started in mid nineties as a personal hobby to share
            oneâ€™s thoughts has indeed come a long way. Initially, it was nothing
            more than an extension of diary writing but in no time, it turned into
            a powerful medium. Soon, people started using it as a source of secondary
            income and some were even lucky enough to be full time, professional bloggers.
            Today, it is used widely by businesses as part of their marketing strategy.</p>
